# Wrangle and Analyse Twitter data - WeRateDogs
-----------------------------------------------
The project involves wrangling  archived Twitter data , analyse the cleaned data and draw insights from the observations. The dataset considered, twitter_archive_enhanced.csv  is the  enhanced tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. 

The entire process has been captured under wrangle_report.html and act_report.html
Only select quality and tidiness issues have been considered for wrangling and subsequent analysis. Additional data used for wrangling has been downloaded via Twitter API.

Note - At this point,modelling the data has not been considered in this work and this will be a task to be undertaken.
